  <p class="lead" id="about-lead-text">Hey all! My name is Trixie Tiger, and I am your Tiger Aesthetic trainer and technician. I first started my lash business when I turned 17 and offered only classic lashes. With over 4 yearsâ€™ experience and multiple beauty certificates I have expanded my knowledge to give you all the best tips/tricks I have learnt.</p>
  <p class="lead">As well as running Tiger Aesthetics I am also a 3rd year student studying Economics at university. I think goals are very important if you want your business to succeed, it allows you to create a vision of where you want to be and focus your attention on how you will get there. No goal is too small, so be ambitious and never give up!</p>
  <p class="lead">I am a very social person, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, going out and living life. I enjoy travelling around the world and experiencing new things. A huge reason as to why I enjoy lashing is the social aspect. However, at the same time it can be therapeutic, and I love spending one on one time with my clients.</p>
