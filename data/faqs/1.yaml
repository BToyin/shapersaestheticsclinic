question: "Do dermal fillers hurt?"
answer: "Depending on your individual pain tolerance, and where youâ€™re using the filler, discomfort levels vary. We use a medical strength topical numbing agent to make all filler injections as comfortable as possible. Most people report little more than mild discomfort."
