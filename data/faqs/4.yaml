question: "Are the treatments suitable for anyone?"
answer: "Treatments wouldn't be suitable if you were under the age of 18 years, or had a known allergy or sensitivity to particular products or their ingredients, including local anaesthetics. They also wouldn't be recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women, or for those with skin infections near the areas requiring injection. If you're taking certain treatments which affect blood clotting, such as Aspirin, Warfarin, Clopidogrel or Omega-3 oils, you should contact me about the suitability of the treatments for you."
