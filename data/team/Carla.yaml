bio: "Hello all, I’m Carla. I am proud to be part of the team at Shapers, working in reception and sales. Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of being part of the Shapers family, and I’m fortunate to say that my job doesn’t feel like work—it’s a passion. Every day, I arrive with a smile, eager to connect with my wonderful colleagues and clients alike. My journey with Shapers began as one of Jo’s clients many years ago, and today, I am privileged to work alongside her. It fills me with joy to see our clients, both old and new, leave our clinic not only satisfied but truly elated with their treatments. Here at Shapers, we ensure that every client walks out the door feeling their absolute best."
