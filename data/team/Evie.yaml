bio: "I’m Evie, I’m a Beauty therapist.
I have had the ultimate experience of learning beauty techniques and the importance of wellbeing here at Shapers Beauty salon.  At Shapers, I am trained in 3D Lipo, Caci Facials and all our luxury facials.  I enjoy understanding the difference that both treatments can make to enhance the improvement of skin and muscle tone and the feeling of have a face lift without the surgery. Giving that youthful appearance to clients making them feel better about themselves and that’s the best part of my job.
Also as the Beauty industry is revolutionary, the training I am receiving has a focus on self improvement and it’s important that clients leave feeling their best."
