bio: "Hi, I'm Trixie. I am a Lash and Brow Artist, specialising in lash extensions and semi-permanent make up.  I have always had an artistic hand, which helps me to provide expert microblading and semi-permanent makeup. A huge reason as to why I enjoy lashing is the social aspect. However, at the same time it can be therapeutic, and I love spending one on one time with my clients."
