text: "Gosh, where to begin. I have been searching for 2 years for a fully trained and experienced aesthetic practitioner, due to ill health negatively affecting the way I look. I drove 3 hours from east Yorkshire to Shapers and left this clinic absolutely thrilled, I was speechless at the results. The warm welcome, the cleanliness, the excellent and professional service. Jo is incredibly talented in her craft, the team are great and I'm in no doubt I made the right decision. I received PDO Threads, Botox, fillers, Microblading. If you are in any doubt, please see my before and after photos, what they have achieved on my behalf is amazing."
