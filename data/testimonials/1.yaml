text: "I don’t think I could ever go anywhere else after being with Trixie for well over a year now. Not only is she incredibly professional, kind, and funny but she genuinely cares about her clients. She always does her best to fit me in as I’m a bit of a last-minute nelly and does my lashes incredibly well! Their retention along with her recommendations have meant my lashes have stayed at optimal health since I have been with her! I loved the way Trixie did my lashes so much that I undertook a training course with her where I spent the day learning how to do lashes. The training was incredibly descriptive, with a model, manual and kit included which meant I could practice on my friends afterwards! Trixie is brilliant and for anybody wanting to use her services and undertake her course my advice would be to just do it!"
