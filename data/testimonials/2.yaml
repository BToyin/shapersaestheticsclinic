text: "I recently had my eyebrows micro bladed at Shapers beauty and Aesthetic clinic. I have to say it was the best decision I made. I absolutely love my new brows, the shape, colour. everything. I have had so many compliments on them! The staff are all very friendly and Jo the lady who did my brows, talked me through everything and we discussed together what look I wanted to achieve. Jo was very professional in her approach and put me at ease throughout the procedure. and my brows look fantastic!"
