text: "I recently had the pleasure of getting my lashes and brows done at shapers by the lovely Trixie.  The entire experience was nothing short of incredible. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome which made the entire process feel luxurious and pampering.
When it comes to lashes, I have always been a fan of enhancing my natural look without going overboard. Trixie understands my wants and needs, and understood this perfectly and provided me with the perfect set of lash extensions.
Trixie also offers  a variety of options for brows. I decided to go for a brow lamination, which tamed my unruly brows and gave them a more defined shape. Trixie did an amazing job, and the result was truly remarkable. My brows looked effortlessly perfect, and I was able to achieve that full and defined look without having to spend hours every morning shaping them.
Overall, getting my lashes and brows done by Trixie was a fantastic experience. The salon was clean and inviting, and the results were outstanding. I highly recommend her services to anyone looking to improve their appearance and achieve that effortlessly beautiful look."
