text: "I have been coming to Jo for all my aesthetic needs since 2018 so this review is long overdue! But after having my PDO threads done I felt that I needed to review because I can’t recommend them enough my face is tight and firm without looking ‘done’ and I have had many compliments from friends, family and work colleagues saying I look really well! Extremely glad I had them and looking forward to coming back to the salon for my Botox top up as it’s such a lovely welcoming environment all the staff are friendly, I wouldn't go anywhere else, and I can’t recommend Jo enough. If you are thinking of booking just go ahead and book!"
