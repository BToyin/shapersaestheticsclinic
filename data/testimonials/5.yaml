text: "I'd been going to Trixie for my lashes for some time, so it only seemed right to go to her when I wanted to train to be a lash tech myself! I'm so glad I did! I really enjoyed my days training, especially the 1-1 training as I felt I got the most out of my training! The whole course was relaxed but insightful and I felt confident enough to start my lash journey straight away! Highly recommend!"
